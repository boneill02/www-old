title: "Why RSS Is So Important Today"

RSS is an amazing format for listing news articles, blog posts,
podcasts, and pretty much anything else. But with Google News,
Snapchat's news platform, and other news "hubs", RSS has become more
important than ever for preventing the spread of misinformation,
discrimination based on opinions, and overreliance on corporate
services.

RSS readers provide the basis for decentralization of information
received on the internet. If you use an RSS reader, chances are you
have multiple feeds from different sites on it. This means that you
are not relying on the same service for all your news. The RSS
reader you use is hopefully free software; in that case you don't have
to worry about it disrespecting your freedom, so think of it like a
mailbox. It takes all the mail you get from these different places and
puts it in one place. A mailbox doesn't say "no" to people with
certain opinions. It can't discriminate, and neither should your news
outlet.

RSS readers also happen to be very convenient. Once you copy your
favorite feeds' URLs into it, it will list the content of all of them
in a hopefully clean and simple way (I know Newsboat for GNU/Linux and
spaRSS for Android do). This reason alone is not good enough of
course, as the aforementioned points are much more important, but it
does help greatly.

RSS is a great platform for many reasons, so if you're not using it
yet, a great place to start would be downloading a free app like
spaRSS or Feeder for Android (in F-Droid for Replicant) or Liferea
for GNU/Linux. My blog is available on RSS as well under
