# Review of a Lenovo Thinkpad X200 with Libreboot

[Libreboot](https://libreboot.org) allows one to free his/her computer
from the shackles of proprietary boot firmware, which can restrict the
operating systems that can be booted or the hardware peripherals that
can be used with the computer. However, Libreboot is only available on
older machines. [Purism](https://puri.sm)'s Librem 5 smartphone and
[Raptor Computing Systems](https://www.raptorcs.com/)' Talos II
desktop are the only machines I know of that have a completely free
boot firmware from the factory. The Thinkpad X200 sells for way
cheaper than both of those, and is also a very portable, lightweight
laptop.

## My Specs

I currently have an Intel Core 2 Duo P8400, a 480GB SSD, and 4GB of
DDR3 RAM installed in this machine, although it can hold up to 8GB
DDR3 RAM. I also have a 2TB SSHD in the ultrabase dock's disc drive
bay. The machine runs fast enough for what I do. It doesn't compile
code as fast as I wish it could, but that is a sacrifice I must make
for my freedom.

I also have a 9-cell battery in the machine, which holds charge for
about 5-6 hours. I can change out the battery if it runs out, as well,
which is very useful. I have two spare batteries: one 6-cell and one
more 9-cell. Finally, I have a wireless card installed that can be
used with drivers on the linux-libre kernel, as well as an ExpressCard
3x USB 3.0 port card.

## The Ultrabase

The ultrabase is very useful. I have it plugged in to my external
monitor, mouse, keyboard, so when I get home I can plug it in and
use it as a desktop in a few seconds. It is also plugged into a power
source, and like I said before, there is a 2TB SSHD in the disc drive
bay.

## Should You Buy It?

Yes. It is not very expensive, and it is very modular. You can
replace or upgrade parts as needed, and it can run a fully free
operating system and Libreboot supports it. It is one of the few
ethical technology items you can purchase. If you find one in decent
condition for a good price (they range from around $50-250), I'd
recommend buying it.
