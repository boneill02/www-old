I run [Parabola GNU/Linux-Libre](https://parabola.nu) with exclusively
free software on my Lenovo Thinkpad X200. On my phone, I run
[Replicant](https://replicant.us) with all free software on the
operating system level. Sadly, my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 still has a
proprietary bootloader. In terms of programming, I enjoy writing
software that makes my life easier, whether it be in shell, C, Python,
or Guile. Those are my preferred programming languages. I use
[Vim](https://vim.org) as my text editor and
[st](https://st.suckless.org) as my terminal emulator.
[bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) is my window manager.
All have slight modifications. The shell I use is typically
[zsh](https://www.zsh.org/), but I have `/bin/sh` symlinked to
[dash](http://gondor.apana.org.au/~herbert/dash/), which is narrowly
POSIX compliant, so all my scripts do hopefully run in any
POSIX-compliant shell.
