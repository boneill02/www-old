I am interested in computers, history, and music. Computers are my
main interest these days though, and so this site is mostly based
around that interest. I run
[Parabola GNU/Linux-Libre](https://parabola.nu) on my laptop and on my
desktop. In terms of programming, I enjoy writing software that makes
my life easier, whether it be in shell, C, or Guile. Those are my
preferred programming languages. I use [Vim](https://vim.org) as my
text editor and [st](https://st.suckless.org) as my terminal emulator.
[bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) is my window manager.
All have slight modifications. My shell is
[bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), but I have `/bin/sh`
symlinked to [dash](http://gondor.apana.org.au/~herbert/dash/) so all
my scripts do hopefully run in dash or any other POSIX-compliant
shell.
